# Specificity-Classified Random Forest: Evaluation of Tennis Momentum Prediction

# This is a research on the momentum of tennis players' matches that I conducted a few years ago (although I think this research was not very successful and had many limitations, it was just an attempt). 

In competitive sports, especially in tennis matches, accurate prediction of score fluctuations and momentum changes is crucial for players and coaches to formulate effective strategies. Traditional models may have limitations in considering individual player specificity and match dynamics. Therefore, our research is dedicated to innovatively improving traditional models to better capture and predict fluctuations and momentum changes in matches, which is highly important for the scientific forecasting and development of sports.

In this study, we innovatively propose a fluctuation prediction model called Specifici-ty-Classified Remodeled Forest (SRC), based on a traditional random forest model with strong interpretability. This model incorporates dimensionality reduction and clustering al-gorithms to precisely predict score fluctuations and momentum changes in tennis matches. We also extend this model to design a turning point prediction model based on match data. Compared to general traditional models, the turning point prediction model can provide more accurate assessments of feature importance, quantifying the different factors that impact players. Leveraging the specificity of different players, the model offers profound insights into match outcomes.

Firstly, our model, based on the random forest algorithm, individually models each player, forming a group of random forests. It utilizes principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction and employs K-means clustering for clustering. Ultimately, we obtain a classifica-tion random forest group that combines clustering features, becoming our novel model. It enhances universality while considering player specificity, enabling the determination of which player performs better at specific times in the match and how well they perform. Ad-ditionally, we provide a visualization depicting the development of the match.

After evaluating the model's performance, we further assess its practicality and extend the probability prediction model into a "momentum" model. We define momentum as the cu-mulative change in scoring probability advantage for one side relative to the other during a match. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis is used to examine the correlation between model outputs (predicted scoring probabilities) and actual match results. Through this method, we demonstrate that fluctuations and consecutive successes in a match are not random; "momentum" plays a significant role.

Furthermore, the identification of momentum turning points is a crucial application extension of our model. Based on the momentum difference in actual events, we define the concept of turning points to help determine when momentum in a match will shift from one side to the other. We develop a turning point model to predict match fluctuations based on these turning points, visually illustrating the factors related to feature importance. Considering the differ-ences in momentum fluctuations in past matches, we suggest that players should pay more attention to adapting in new matches against different opponents.

Additionally, we use model sensitivity detection to test the performance of our developed model in matches of the same sport and study the impact of gender differences. We also examine how our model performs in badminton matches, ultimately proving the high prac-ticality of our model in tennis.

While our model excels in predicting match outcomes, we acknowledge its limitations in certain situations. Future research will need to consider more factors, such as players' psy-chological states and weather conditions on match days, to further enhance the accuracy and applicability of the model. In summary, our research provides a new methodological per-spective for analyzing tennis matches and valuable references for the analysis and prediction of other competitive sports.

# 1 Introduction

# 1.1 Background
In the 2023 Wimbledon men's singles final, a captivating duel unfolded, featuring a clash between the emerging talent Carlos Alcaraz and the seasoned champion Novak Djokovic. Alcaraz's triumph marked the end of Djokovic's unbeaten Wimbledon streak since 2013, symbolizing the rise of a new generation of players.

The match showcased significant fluctuations, from Djokovic's initial lead to Alcaraz's comeback, highlighting various turning points. This real-world demonstration emphasized the elusive nature of "momentum" in tennis competitions, a concept widely discussed in sports, though challenging to quantify. Many believe that momentum plays a pivotal role in influ-encing the flow and outcome of a match.

# 1.2 Restatement of the Problem
Developing a Momentum and Match Flow Model is essential for understanding the dynamics of tennis matches. The model, focusing on player performance and serving advantages, should offer visual insights into match progression. Evaluating Momentum Randomness de-termines if fluctuations and player success are random. Predicting fluctuations involves building a model based on match data to provide strategic recommendations. Assessing Generalization Ability and Model Improvement entails testing the model on various match data to enhance accuracy and discuss factors for improvement.

# 1.3 Literature Review
The first study contrasts domestic and international tennis research, proposing innova-tions for the big data era, including a graphical tool for player state tracking, a tennis predic-tion method combining Markov models and an improved ranking system, and the use of Monte Carlo simulation. Logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and support vector ma-chine models are employed for data processing, achieving a balance between prediction ac-curacy and time cost. Using ATP tournament data from 2000 to 2019, the study determines the optimal prediction model. The second article analyzes men's singles match data from the 2006-2014 US Open, revealing a significant momentum effect, especially in critical matches. Higher-ranked players demonstrate better performance in return games and are less affected by momentum, which weakens as the match progresses. Both reviews underscore the mo-mentum effect's importance in tennis research, with big data analysis and machine learning offering valuable tools for understanding match patterns and player performance. Future re-search can explore practical applications and enhance match prediction accuracy by inte-grating the momentum effect with other factors.

# 4 Specificity-Classified Remodeled Model based on Traditional Random Forest

1.Data Preprocessing Label Encoding: The data includes categorical variables presented as rows. Code labeling is applied to preprocess the data, facilitating model access. The last three columns of tennis match data are encoded with unique integer values for each label.

2.Outlier Handling: Outliers, significantly deviating from the acceptable margin, can impact experiment accuracy. The three times standard deviation method detects and ad-dresses outliers. This principle identifies the range within which approximately 99.7% of normal data lies. Outliers beyond this range are marked as null values for data accuracy.

3.Missing Value Handling: The Lagrange interpolation method is used to fill in miss-ing data.

4.Data Standardization (Normalization): To address varying formats and magnitudes, data standardization is performed to make the data uniform in scale (ranging from 0 to 1).

Traditional Model Comparison and Evaluation: The study aims to develop a predictive model capturing dynamic score trends during matches. Various modeling techniques, in-cluding random forests, entropy weighting, support vector machines (SVM), and lightweight gradient boosting machines (LGBM), are explored. The comparative analysis focuses on determining the most effective model based on key performance indicators.

# 4.1 Model Evaluation Criteria
(1) To evaluate the model effectively, we adopted the "time series rolling forecast divi-sion" technique, considering the chronological nature of our data. This method involves it-eratively training on the earlier portion of the time series and testing on the later part, en-suring no future information leakage. The process, commonly using an 80% training and 20% testing split, provides metrics for performance evaluation, progressively advancing the roll-ing window at each iteration.

(2) Selection of Partial Performance Metrics as Model Evaluation Criteria Taking into account the characteristics of the sample set and the various requirements of the model men-tioned in the previous section, we referred to general performance evaluation methods and selected some of the most typical ones: 

1.Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC)

2.Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC)

3.Accuracy&Match Results

# 4.1.1 Model Performance Comparison

Model Performance Comparison: 

Random Forest: Outperforming other models, the Random Forest model exhibited excellent performance across all evaluation criteria, boasting an AUC of 0.672, surpassing the entropy weighting method. This underscores its superior accuracy and stability in predicting players' performances at specific match intervals. 

Support Vector Machine (SVM): While SVM is a powerful tool, its performance in this study slightly lagged behind Random Forest, with lower ROC, AUC (0.649), and accuracy. This could be attributed to SVM's relative inflexibility and adaptability compared to Ran-dom Forest in handling the unique features and structure of the dataset. 

Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM): Despite its efficiency with large datasets, LGBM's performance in terms of ROC, AUC (0.587), and accuracy fell short compared to Random Forest. This suggests that, while effective for large datasets, LGBM may struggle to capture the nuanced dynamics essential for this specific prediction task. 

Entropy Weighting Method: Utilizing information entropy for indicator weighting, the en-tropy weighting method yielded subpar results. Its effectiveness in evaluating models proved weaker than Random Forest, likely due to limitations in handling dynamic match changes and real-time player performances, hindering its ability to capture subtle trends in matches.

# 4.1.2 Conclusion
The comprehensive evaluation highlighted the Random Forest as the most effective model for predicting the performance of players at specific time points during a match. Comparative analysis indicates that while SVM, LGBM, and entropy weighting may have potential in other domains, they are not as suitable for this particular application as Random Forest. They exhibited lower scores in ROC, AUC, and accuracy, suggesting limitations in handling the complexity and dynamics of real-time sports data. Future research could focus on further improving these models or exploring new approaches to enhance predictive accu-racy in sports analysis.

# 4.1.3 Model Development Details
Widely employed for sports match outcome predictions, the traditional random forest model utilizes an ensemble of decision trees to bolster accuracy and reliability. Construction begins with dataset partitioning using the time-series rolling prediction method. Introducing randomness by considering a subset of features at each decision tree node prevents overuse of specific features, employing the Gini coefficient for this purpose. Recursive splitting con-tinues until a predetermined tree depth or a sample threshold is reached. Post-pruning with cost complexity prevents overfitting, and prediction involves inputting new samples into each tree, with results aggregated through voting or averaging. This ensemble method mitigates overfitting risks, enhancing overall accuracy and stability. The presentation of typical deci-sion trees underscores the model's scientific training process.

The process parameters here reflect the total contribution of each sample and the sam-ple contribution in each tree. From the chart, it is evident that the establishment process of our random forest adheres well to the randomness of features, indicating the reliability of our building process.

Performance charts of the traditional random forest training Above are some perfor-mance charts of the traditional random forest. While the training of the traditional random forest still requires improvement and falls within the intermediate level, the scalability of the random forest itself allows us to further enhance its performance, evolving it into a novel model. Details regarding the novel model will be elaborated in the following sections.
When applying the random forest model for predicting tennis match scores, traditional methods typically rely on the analysis of overall player data, attempting to capture patterns and trends that represent the majority of cases. Although traditional random forests exhibit data comprehensiveness, good generalization, and robustness, they lack specificity, have limited accuracy, and lack personalized strategies. For these reasons, we have developed a specificity-classified remodeled model based on the traditional random forest.

# 4.1.4 Specificity-Classified Remodeled Model
(1) Concept and Preliminary Verification of the Specificity-Classified Remodeled Model

As mentioned earlier, traditional random forest models, due to their strong scalability features, allow us to remodel them based on the characteristics of the scenario. For the over-all sample set, we can easily apply big data methods using program code to divide it into reflective charts of each player's individual match situations, as seen in the partial player score situation chart below.

The visual representations of score changes for individual players were enhanced using the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (loess) algorithm, which performs weighted linear regression on local data points, resulting in visually appealing curves. However, the original data plots were characterized by discrete and abrupt lines. The significant variation in scoring situations for each player led us to question the effectiveness of traditional random forest methods, especially for new players. To address this, we propose training specific random forests individually for each player and aggregating them into a multi-random forest model with classification information. This approach allows for targeted predictions based on a player's characteristics. To validate the feasibility of this algorithm, we conducted separate traditional decision tree training for each player, measuring feature importance using the Permutation method, which considers interaction effects between features.

We discovered that, for different players, the impact of different attributes on their per-formance in the next point is so significant that it led us to a new understanding of the limi-tations of traditional random forests. This also highlights the significance of our new model. To further validate the superior performance of our model, we generated ROC curves for each individual player by setting up separate models, analyzing the specificity random forest's performance. The ROC curves are presented below:

For the ROC curves of the specificity random forest prediction models established for each player (partial players), it can be observed that, for each player-specific model, the AUC values for each model are greater than the AUC value of the traditional random forest model, reaching around 0.7. The lowest AUC is around 0.67, while the highest is around 0.8. Therefore, we have preliminarily validated the reliability of our new model. However, the final validation is still at a certain distance, and the detailed description of the final valida-tion will be conducted in the next section on model validation and testing. Hence, here, we only perform basic partial validation to confirm the meaningfulness of our work.

(2) Specificity-Classified Remodeled Model Algorithm Based on our exploration of the specificity-classified remodeled model, we have designed the following algorithm. We will present it in both schematic and algorithm distribution forms.

Initially, we segment the complete sample set into individual sets for each player. Next, we concurrently apply the traditional random forest algorithm to each player's set, resulting in the formation of the random forest prediction model for each player, denoted as the ran-dom forest group Q*. This group comprises random forests Q1, Q2, Q3...Qn (with n being the player count). Subsequently, for each model in Q*, we compute the feature importance distribution data using the previously outlined method in this document.

The feature importance distribution data undergoes dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a technique that identifies principal components in high-dimensional data and maps it to a lower-dimensional space by maximizing variance through linear transformation. PCA involves centering the data, computing the covariance matrix, and calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The top k eigenvalues and corre-sponding eigenvectors are selected as principal components, forming a new feature matrix. K-means clustering is then applied to the dimensionality-reduced data, partitioning it into six clusters based on the nearest mean, with cluster centers recalculated iteratively until stability or a predetermined number of iterations is reached.

The random forest groups Q^ are constructed for each cluster's player model, and the final prediction is completed. For each prediction, the clustering algorithm identifies the player type, assigning them to the appropriate branch of the random forest group for the final result determination.

# 4.1.5 Model Validation and Testing 

# 4.4.1 Testing
Following the time series rolling forecast partitioning method we have consistently used before, and incorporating the new model for Return on Assets (ROA) performance testing, we ultimately obtained the ROA plot for the new model as shown below:

It can be observed that the new model exhibits a higher AUC value, showing a signifi-cant improvement compared to past traditional random forest models and other models.

#4.1.6 Correlation between Score Probability and Actual Score

Standardizing score probabilities and adjusting actual scores accordingly is a method that makes the data more interpretable and analyzable. This approach simplifies complex relationships by scaling the data, transforming them into intuitive visuals or models.

Standardization of Score Probabilities

Standardization is a preprocessing method aimed at eliminating the influence of dif-ferent dimensions and magnitudes, making the data conform to a standard normal distribu-tion (with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1). In this scenario, standardizing score probabilities means adjusting the probabilities for all players to the same magnitude, facili-tating comparison and analysis.

Algorithm:

1.	Calculate the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of score probabilities for all play-ers in all matches.
2.	Standardize the score probabilities for each player (P) using the formula: Pstandard-ized=P−μσPstandardized=σP−μ Through this formula, the score probabilities for each player are transformed to a scale with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
3.	After standardizing score probabilities, the next step involves adjusting actual scores to match this standardized scale. The purpose of this step is to showcase the variation in actual scores concerning standardized score probabilities.

Algorithm:
Determine the mapping relationship: Establish a mapping function based on the rela-tionship between standardized score probabilities and actual scores. The goal of this function is to convert standardized score probabilities into the expected range of actual scores.

Adjust actual scores using the mapping function to ensure that changes in score proba-bilities and actual scores are comparable on the same scale for analysis.

Visualization

Through the aforementioned steps, both score probabilities and actual scores are ad-justed to the same standardized scale. Finally, the standardized score probabilities and ad-justed actual scores are visualized to intuitively demonstrate the relationship between score probabilities and actual scores.

The advantage of this method is its ability to clearly display the relationship between score probabilities and actual scores for different players or under different match conditions. This approach makes analysis and comparison more intuitive and straightforward. Addition-ally, it provides a powerful tool for gaining a deeper understanding of a specific player's performance in specific situations.

With the presentation of the score prediction and actual score relationship chart, we can provide a differential chart illustrating the relationship between score predictions and actual scores. It is important to note that due to space limitations, we cannot showcase the situa-tions of all players. To better present the situations of all players, we have opted to create graphs for different subsets of players and present them in the paper. Consequently, the player information corresponding to the chart above and the chart below is different, and we emphasize this clarification to minimize potential misunderstandings.

# 4.1.7 Momentum and Actual Score Analysis
I Analyzing the nuanced relationship between player momentum and actual scores provides comprehensive insights into match dynamics. Momentum, defined as the dynamic change trend in a player's performance, encompasses both current scoring probability and performance trends over time. This analysis explores the definition, characteristics, and detailed examination of the relationship between player momentum and actual scores.
Definition and Characteristics of Momentum: Our approach, based on the specificity-classified remodeled forest model from traditional random forests, determines each player's weights for different attributes through linear regression to ascertain momentum size. Dynamic changes in a player's performance define momentum, which exhibits a lag due to its time series nature. Deviations may exist between momentum and actual scores as momentum reflects trends, not immediate scores.

Analysis of the Relationship between Momentum and Actual Scores:

1.	Lag Analysis:
o	Despite a player's momentum peaking, increased scores may manifest in subsequent rounds, indicating a lag.
o	Quantifying this lag involves comparing the time offset between the momentum change and actual score change curves.

3.	Deviation Analysis:
o	Deviation acknowledges inconsistencies between momentum and actual scores, recognizing that high momentum may not directly translate into points.
o	Analyzing the correlation between momentum and actual scores helps assess deviation, emphasizing the importance of factors like defense and psychological state.
Visualization and Interpretation: Visualizing the relationship involves plotting cumulative curves for momentum and actual scores. The interplay of time offsets and shape differences between these curves enhances our understanding of how momentum influences actual scoring dynamics in tennis matches.

# 5 Task Two: Momentum Model Prediction Evaluation 

# 5.1 Analysis of the Relevance of Momentum to Match Outcomes

# 5.1.1 Method

This study employs the Pearson correlation coefficient method to analyze match data of top-level tennis players. By calculating the correlation coefficient between match momen-tum (such as consecutive points, service game victories, etc.) and match outcomes (e.g., match victories), the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two are assessed. Additionally, hypothesis testing (p-value) is utilized to determine whether the ob-served correlation is statistically significant, and reliability of the results is evaluated through confidence levels.

# 5.1.2 Results

The analysis results indicate that the majority of the athletes involved in the study ex-hibit an extremely high positive correlation between match momentum and match outcomes (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.99823 to 0.99986). Among these, several athletes show correlation coefficients close to 1, suggesting a very strong positive linear relationship between momentum and match results. The corresponding p-values are statistically signifi-cant in most cases, often well below the standard level of 0.05, indicating that these rela-tionships are unlikely to occur by chance. Furthermore, the confidence levels in the vast majority of cases are close to or equal to 1, further emphasizing the reliability of these find-ings.

# 5.1.3 Conclusion

The findings of this study provide compelling evidence for understanding the role of momentum in tennis matches. Through Pearson correlation coefficient and hypothesis test-ing analysis of match data from top-level tennis players, this research demonstrates a signif-icant positive correlation between match momentum and outcomes. This discovery chal-lenges the perspective that match results are primarily determined by random factors and supports the crucial role of momentum in matches. Therefore, recognizing and leveraging momentum in matches may be a key strategy for improving performance and results.

# 6 Momentum Turning Points and Fluctuation Prediction Model

# 6.1 Momentum Turning Point Prediction Model

# 6.1.1 Definition and Method
In this study, we define the change in the sign of momentum difference as the turning point of a match and use this definition as the output variable for the model. Input variables include various match statistics and factors that may influence momentum. By training a random forest model, we aim to identify and quantify the key factors affecting match turn-ing points for each individual player. The analysis involves tennis match data, including but not limited to score records, serve success rates, direct points (Aces), and unforced errors. The random forest algorithm is employed to process this data as it is a powerful machine learning model capable of handling numerous input variables and identifying factors that have the greatest impact on the output variable.

# 6.1.2 Results
The model results reveal key factors significantly influencing match turning points, listing them for each player's specific situation. In particular, the model indicates a close correlation between changes in these factors for each player and the transition of momentum. Analyzing the impact weight maps of the random forest, we can identify the key factors most likely to lead to momentum changes in a match.

# 6.1.3 Conclusion
Through the analysis of tennis match data and the application of the random forest model, this study successfully identified key factors influencing the turning points of match momentum. These findings not only enhance our understanding of changes in match mo-mentum but also provide practical strategic advice for coaches and athletes, assisting them in better coping with momentum fluctuations and improving match performance.

# 6.2 Recommendations for Players in New Matches
The model underscores the importance of adapting serve strategies to exploit opponents' receiving styles, aiming for strategic advantages in match momentum. Additionally, it emphasizes the critical role of minimizing unforced errors to sustain or shift momentum, urging players to prioritize stability and adopt a cautious playing style when necessary. Mental resilience is highlighted as a key factor, emphasizing the cultivation of a positive mindset and focused composure during various match situations to navigate momentum fluctuations. In-depth analysis of opponents' playing styles and momentum patterns is recommended to inform strategic development, facilitating the identification and capitalization of momentum shifts. Furthermore, the model advocates for tactical adaptation, suggesting that recognizing specific match factors associated with turning points prompts players to make timely adjustments, potentially reversing the course of the match.

# 6.3 Fluctuation Prediction Model
# 6.3.1 Establishment and Performance Evaluation of the Fluctuation Prediction Model
Our fluctuation model, built on the random forest algorithm, excels in handling complex data, ensuring robust generalization and interpretability. Personalized for each player, it un-dergoes training with historical match data, emphasizing the prediction of momentum turning points. Post-training evaluation, using metrics like accuracy and recall rate, indicates high prediction accuracy in tennis matches. However, external factors like court surface and weather affect performance. Application to other sports, like table tennis, reveals decreased accuracy, highlighting the importance of sport-specific considerations in future develop-ments.

# 6.3.2 Model Testing Results in Other Matches
1.	Generalization Challenges: The model's accuracy in predicting match momentum turning points may vary when applied to new datasets due to diverse match characteristics, including changes in player styles, mental states, and physical conditions.
2.	Influence of Match Conditions: Different match types (e.g., Grand Slam vs. ATP 250) and court surfaces (clay, grass, hard) can significantly impact match flow and outcomes. The model must demonstrate robust generalization capabilities to accommodate variations in these con-ditions.
3.	Cross-Sport Applicability: Although developed for tennis, the model's core theory and methods may offer insights for analyzing match momentum in other sports, particularly those with similar scoring patterns and game rhythms, such as table tennis. However, adjustments to specific pa-rameters and features may be necessary based on the unique characteristics of each sport.
6.3.3 Directions for Model Improvement
1.	Consider Additional Factors: Improve prediction accuracy by incorpo-rating additional match-related factors, such as players' psychological pressure indicators and match-day weather conditions.
2.	Dynamic Parameter Adjustment: Enhance model performance by dynamically adjusting parameters based on specific match conditions, including court surface and historical player matchups.
3.	Analyze Player Compatibility: Refine the model to analyze momentum change patterns based on the stylistic compatibility between players, par-ticularly under specific player matchup combinations.
4.	Cross-Validation and Multi-Sport Testing: Evaluate the model's gen-eralization capabilities and adjustability through cross-validation in various matches and sports events, facilitating optimization and im-provement.

# 7 Sensitivity Analysis
7.1 Model Sensitivity Analysis in Other Tennis Events (Male Players)
To verify the sensitivity of our model to different influencing factors, we selected the data from "Novak Djokovic v Tsitsipas Full Match | Australian Open 2024 Exhibition, second game of the first set, 15:40 game" as a data source for sensitivity analysis in other tennis events (male players). Our team members watched the relevant match video link and man-ually recorded the same dataset as mentioned in the title. We input this dataset into our model and obtained ROC curves, comparing them with the original results.

It can be observed that the new model still demonstrates excellent anti-interference performance under the new interference conditions, with only a slight decrease in the AUC value. This indicates that the sensitivity analysis results of the new model for other events (male athletes) in the tennis scenario are favorable. The speculated reason is that this com-prehensive random forest model has strong semantic interpretability, resulting in robust an-ti-interference performance in similar event scenarios.

# 7.2 Model Sensitivity Analysis for Other Events in the Tennis Scenario (Female Athletes)
To verify the sensitivity of our model under different interference factors, we selected the Qinwen Zheng vs. Aryna Sabalenka Extended Highlights | Australian Open 2024 Final, Second Set, Game 1, 30:40 as the data source for the model sensitivity analysis of other events in the tennis scenario (female athletes). Our team members watched the relevant match video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLdkTzDbXVE and manually recorded the same dataset as mentioned in the title. We input this dataset into our model and obtained the ROC curve as follows:

It can be observed that under the new interference conditions, the new model still demonstrates excellent resistance to interference, with only a slight decrease in the AUC value. This indicates that the sensitivity analysis results of the new model in other tennis scenarios (female athletes) are satisfactory. The speculated reason is consistent with the pre-vious section, suggesting that the classification features of feature importance for female athletes are similar to those of males.

# 7.3 Sensitivity Analysis for Other Racquet Sports
To validate the sensitivity of our model under different interference factors, we selected the HSBC BWF World Tour Finals 2023 | Shi Yu Qi (CHN) vs. Viktor Axelsen (DEN) | Game 1: 11:21 as the data source for sensitivity analysis of our model in other racquet sports (taking badminton as an example). Our team members watched the relevant match video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyK0nwAdO_g and manually recorded the same da-taset as mentioned in the title. We inputted this dataset into our model and obtained the ROC curve as follows:

It can be observed that the ROC curve of the model in other events shows significant errors, with the AUC value dropping to 0.483, completely deviating from the normal thresh-old of 0.5. This indicates that the new model is less applicable in scenarios involving other sports. The speculated reason is that the semantic model in tennis scenes may not be suitable for other sports, as the metrics in tennis significantly differ from those in badminton, likely due to the variations in playing styles. Due to limitations in the dataset, we couldn't find a corresponding large dataset for badminton matches, leading us to predict badminton scenar-ios using tennis's large dataset, resulting in these outcomes.

# 8 Strengths and Weaknesses 
This enhanced random forest model, rooted in comprehensive match data analysis, en-sures evidence-based predictions rather than relying on intuition. The personalized approach tailors predictions for individual players using specific random forests, considering unique playing styles, endurance, and strategies. Dynamic momentum analysis focuses on shifts during crucial game moments, providing strategic advantages for players. The model's uni-versal framework showcases adaptability to different players and conditions, extending its applicability beyond tennis. Visual representations aid coaches and players in understanding complex data, facilitating strategic planning and adjustments during matches. However, weaknesses include complex implementation requiring substantial computational resources, dependence on data availability and quality, universality testing across various factors, re-al-time constraints in match applications, and overfitting risks for less analyzed players.

Researchers: Wang Yi (Team Leader), Wang He Liang, Zhang Heng

This is a research on the momentum of tennis players' matches that I conducted a few years ago (although I think this research was not very successful and had many limitations, it was just an attempt).
